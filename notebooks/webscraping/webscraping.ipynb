    "\n",
    "**Webscraping** is the process of collecting (or scraping) information from a webpage, in order to use it for further analysis. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is often useful for gathering a large amount of data in a short amount of time, whether it be a large collection of numbers and text from a big table in a single webpage, or to automatically gather data from many different webpages hosting useful information. \n",
    "\n",
    "While much of this data could be collected by hand, say by copying with a pen and paper (or more likely, copying and pasting with a keyboard command), it is much more efficient to gather the data using a computer program.\n",

    "We begin by installing and importing some important code libraries. First, the **requests** library, which handles the process of requesting raw data from a webpage. Next, the **beautifulsoup** library, which takes the raw data from the webpage and reformats it, or interprets it into a form that is easily saved as a data frame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Normally, we just use the **import** command to make the libraries accessible in our code. However, if the libraries are not pre-installed in our system, we need to run the following two **pip install** commands.

To access these types of webpages, we need more powerful tools such as *Selenium* or *Pyppeteer*. \n",
