    " ## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We are interested in creating self-referential sentences like the following:\n",
    "- **This sentence has four e’s in it.**\n",
    "- **This sentence has five e’s in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Both these sentences are true, as the count (four, five) matches the actual number of e's in the sentence. However, the sentence \n",
    "- \"**This sentence has six e’s in it**\" \n",
    "\n",
    "is false. It does not have six e's. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the Cree language (nehiyawewin), we can get a self-referential sentence like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "Mekwâc e-ayamihtâyan ôma, niyânanwâw kika-wâpahten ôma e masinipehikanis.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This translates as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "Right now as you read this, you will see five e's written.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "In Cree syllabics, this is written as:\n",
    "```\n",
    "ᒣᑳᐧᐨ  ᐁ ᐊᔭᒥᐦᑖᔭᐣ  ᐆᒪ,  ᓃᔮᓇᓈᐧᐤ  ᑭᑲ ᐋᐧᐸᐦᑌᐣ  ᐆᒪ  \"ᐁ\"  ᒪᓯᓂᐯᐦᐃᑲᓂᐢ.\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We want to create some Python code to make a sentence in Cree syllabics that tells you how many of each letter it has, and get the count correct. This is tricky, because the numbers in the sentence are made up of letters, and you don't know in advance how many letters there will be in the completed sentence!\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to treat the sentence as an object that gets transformed by the code, based on the count of letters in the sentence. As you update the sentence, you then update the count of letters. Hopefully the updates finally converge to a correct sentence.  This is called a **fixed point** in the set of sentences, under this transformation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking for fixed points in a dynamical system is an important topic in pure and applied mathematics. It is interesting to see it show up in languages as well. \n",
    "\n",

    "## Fixed points\n",
    "\n",
    "A fixed point is a place (or configuration) where the dynamical system naturally stops moving. For instance, when a ball rolls into a valley and stops, this stopping point is called a fixed point. Finding fixed points for a mechanical systems is often key to understanding the physics of that system.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Sentences as dynamical systems\n",
    "\n",
    "We can think of a collection of sentences as the states of a dynamical system, and apply some transformation to a sentence as a way of \"evolving\" the system forward in time, just like a ball rolling forward evolves the physical system of a ball on a hill.\n",
    "\n",
    "For our sentence system, we will take a generic sentence that mentions numbers and letters, and update the numbers based on how many letters show up in that sentence.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A simple example.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's start with the sentence\n",
    "> **This sentence has seven e's in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Looking at the sentence, we see it doesn't have seven e's in it. It only has six. So we update the sentence to indicate six:\n",
    "> **This sentence has six e's in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we count and see the sentence has only four e's in it. So we update it again, replacing six with four. Now it says\n",
    "> **This sentence has four e's in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Now when we count, we see this sentence really does have four e's in it. AHA! So this sentence is a fixed point in the dynamical system -- if we try to update it, the four will remain as four, and the sentence no longer has to be corrected.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we have found a fixed point, and this gives us a self-referential sentence. That is, the following sentence accurately describes itself:\n",
    "> **This sentence has four e's in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "## The problem with cycles\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, we don't always get to fixed points. The sentences could cycle between two (or more) sentences in a loop and never get to a fixed point. For instance, look at this example:\n",
    "> **This thing has one e in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We count and see there are in fact two e's in it. So we update the sentence and get\n",
    "> **This thing has two e's in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "We count again and see this last sentence has only one e in it. So we update the sentence to get\n",
    "> **This thing has one e in it.**\n",
    "\n",
    "YIKES! We are back at the beginning sentence. So each time we apply the count transformation, the sentence will just alternate between one or two e's in it, and never settle down to a fixed point. \n",
    "\n",
    "Our programming examples below will have to look out for never-ending cycles. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Longer examples\n",
    "\n",
    "We would like to try to find longer self-referential sentences, in the Cree language, using syllabics. We will use the same idea of finding fixed points for sentences with numbers in them, but use computer code to do the calculations for us. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we explain a bit about numbers in the Cree language, and the syllabics writing system."

Six vowels appear as pairs indicating short and long versions (**a, â**), (**i, î**), (**o, ô**) while **e** only appears as one version. Note in some dictionaries, **e** is written as **ê,** the long form of the vowel.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Note:\n",
    "The little \"hat\" above the vowel is called a **macron** which is a diacritical mark indicating the vowel is in the long form. It can be written as either a circumflex symbol (as here) or a line. Both marks indicate the same thing. The vowel \"e\" is a special case, there is just one form. \n",
    "\n",
    "These seven vowels and nine of the consonants combine to form syllabics. The following chart organizes the syllabics by lining up rows of consonants and columns of vowels. These combine as a \"consonant + vowel\" to give a basic sound like **wa** or **ta**. There is a last column, Finals, representing the sound where a consonant is added at the end of a vowel sound, like **tah** or **taht.** \n",
