    "Welcome to another Jupyter notebook on baseball analytics. This notebook is a free resource and is part of the Callysto project, which brings data science skills to grades 5 to 12 classrooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, weâ€™ll start by looking at some baseball statistical data, specifically on batters and where they hit the ball out into the field. \n",
    "\n",
    "In real major league baseball, computing statistic are key to understanding how players are valued by their team. The money Moneyball, with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is all about baseball analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are coded using Python, a computer programming language. Python contains words from English and is used by data scientists. Programming languages are how people communicate with computers. Our graphics are done in Plotly, which makes it easy to create line charts, scatter plots and mores. This is all great for understanding the baseball statistics \n",

    "# Spray Charts\n",
    "\n",
    "Knowing the hitting tendencies of a batter can be incredibly helpful when establishing defensive alignment. In today's data-driven baseball world, shifting the fielders around to increase the chances of making an out is commonplace, and becomes more popular each season. With [MLB set to ban shifting](https://www.si.com/mlb/2022/04/26/shifts-increasing-the-opener) in 2023, it remains to be seen how teams will adapt, but we can explore the data behind the strategy.\n",
