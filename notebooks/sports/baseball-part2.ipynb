    "\n",
    "Welcome to another Jupyter notebook on baseball analytics. This notebook is a free resource and is part of the Callysto project, which brings data science skills to grades 5 to 12 classrooms. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook, weâ€™ll start by looking at some baseball statistical data, specifically on batters and what pitches they are good at hitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In real major league baseball, computing statistic are key to understanding how players are valued by their team. The money Moneyball, with Brad Pitt and Jonah Hill is all about baseball analytics. \n",
    "\n",
    "Visualizations are coded using Python, a computer programming language. Python contains words from English and is used by data scientists. Programming languages are how people communicate with computers. Our graphics are done in Plotly, which makes it easy to create line chart, scatter plots and even heat maps. This is all great for understanding the baseball statistics \n",

    "# Strike Zone Heatmaps\n",
    "\n",
    "It can be of strategic interest to know what areas of the strike zone a hitter is most likely to make good contact with the ball in. Hitters want to wait for pitches in those zones, and pitchers want to avoid them. We'll explore two visualizations that can quickly show that: barreled balls, and *all* balls hit into play.\n",
    "\n",
    "This visualization is a construction of a heatmap of a player's ['barreled balls'](https://www.mlb.com/glossary/statcast/barrel). A barreled ball has a specific definition, but in simple terms refers to a hit where the batter has put considerable power and launch angle into the ball, increasing the chances for them to reach base safely:\n",
