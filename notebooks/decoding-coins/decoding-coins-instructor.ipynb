    "#### <font color='red'>After some analysis, the students will determine the winning strategy for any number of starting coins N.  If N is a multiple of 3, they become Player Two and employ the \"reverse-copycat\" strategy described in the above game with 21 coins.  If N is one more than a multiple of 3 (e.g. 4, 7, 10, 13), they become Player One and remove 1 coin on their first move, then follow with the reverse-copycat strategy.  And if N is two more than a multiple of 3 (e.g. 5, 8, 11, 14), they become Player One and remove 2 coins on their first move, then follow with the reverse-copycat strategy.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color='red'>Now have the students generalize the game further, where they can select the starting number of coins N, as well as the maximum number of coins that can be removed on any turn, denoted by the variable M.  For example, have the students try the game with N=100 and M=10, and see if they can beat the computer.  This game is much harder than the original scenario with N=21 and M=2! The computer plays perfectly, and will win the game if the students make a single mistake.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color='red'>The solution to the game (N,M) = (100,10) is to be Player One, and take one coin on the first turn.  This reduces the game to 99 coins.  And then if the computer takes K coins, then we respond by taking 11-K coins.  This reduces the number of coins from 99 to 88 to 77 to 66 to 55 to 44 to 33 to 22 to 11 to 0, and we win the game since we get to 0 coins first.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "#### <font color='red'>If there is enough class time (or if students wish to analyze this problem outside of class hours), have students work on this generalized problem, and investigate patterns.  It turns out that if N is a multiple of M+1, then Player Two has a winning strategy, and if N is not a multiple of M+1, then Player One has a winning strategy.  Have students attempt to discover this \"theorem\" themselves, and determine how they can win against the computer, no matter which values of N and M are chosen.</font>"
