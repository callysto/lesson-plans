    "\n",
    "1. When timbre is set to 1.0, the sound is a sine wave or a very pure tone. The oscilloscope snapshot looks very close to a sinusoid, and matches the synthetic waveform. Why is this?\n",
    "2. When the timbre is set to 0.1, the sound is a synthesized as a clipped sinusoid, which looks like a square wave. The waveform on the oscilloscope looks quite different. How would you describe the shape of the waveform on the oscilloscope? What words would you use? Why do you think the oscilloscope waveform is different than the synthetic waveform?\n",
    "3. These waveforms have a period, or length, in the display, which is measured in sample number. The x-axis is labeled with samples numbers going from 0 to 1024. Counting the distance between the repeating peaks gives the period. For instance, in the image here, the period is 200 samples per cycle.\n",
    "![sine wave](images/sine.png)\n",
    "The connection between frequency and period is given by the formuls\n",
    "$$ Frequency = \\frac{Sample \\, rate}{Period}.$$\n",
    "In the above example, the Sample rate is 44100 samples per second. So we find\n",
    "$$ 220.5 \\, cycles \\, per \\, sec = \\frac{44100 \\, samples \\, per \\, sec }{200\\,  samples \\, per \\, cycle}.$$\n",
    "That is, we have a tone at a frequency of 220.5 Hz. \n",
    "4. Can you verify this formula for other frequencies and periods? \n",
    "\n",
    "NB: In this example, the sample rate was 44100 samples per second. This rate is a common industry standard, also used in recording CDs and audio files for the web. Other common sample rates are:\n",
    "- 8,000 samples per second (for cell phones)\n",
    "- 10,000 samples per second (on old computers)\n",
    "- 22,050 samples per second (half the CD rate)\n",
    "- 44,100 samples per second (CDs and high quality audio)\n",
    "- 48,000 samples per second (movie sound tracks)\n",
    "- 96,000 samples per second (high end digital audio)\n",

    "With this oscilloscope, you can verify that the computer's sampling rate is 44100 or something else. \n",
