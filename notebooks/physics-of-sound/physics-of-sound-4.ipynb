    "\n",
    "We talked about ideal periodic waveforms in this notebook. However, in real life, mustical instruments do not create perfectly periodic waveforms, so this is only an approximation. There is always noise and some random variations in musical instruments and how their produce sound, which is part of the reason why musical instruments have such right and interesting sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a piano is made from wire string under great tension and so they do not vibrate like ideal strings. Instead they behave a bit like metal bars. Their oscillations are more complex and so their harmonics are not exact integer mutliple of their fundamental frequencies. Indeed, piano tuners have to know how this affects the process of tuning the piano from octave to octave, this is called octave stretching or [stretched tuning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stretched_tuning).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we only included seven harmonics in our construction above. In order to be mathematically precise, we should include all harmonics, so we would need an infinite sum. However our ears can only hear the first dozen or so harmonics, so we don't need to worry about these smaller sums."

    "We have seen how a periodic waveform sounds musical, and has a pitch associated with it. The pitch, or numerical frequency of the waveform (in Hertz or cycles per second) is the reciprocal of the period of the waveform (as measured in seconds). \n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematically, periodic waveforms can be expressed as a sum of sine waves of various frequencies. The different sine waves at integer multiples of the fundamental frequency are called the harmonics. Each harmonic has a weight associated with it, indicating how much energy is present in the waveform at that frequency. But adjusting these weights, one changes the timbre of the sound. We can create different waveforms using a tool to select different frequencies and different weights for the harmonics. "
