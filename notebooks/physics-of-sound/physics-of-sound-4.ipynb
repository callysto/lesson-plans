    "## Caveats\n",
    "\n",
    "We talked about ideal periodic waveforms in this notebook. However, in real life, mustical instruments do not create perfectly periodic waveforms, so this is only an approximation to reality. There is always noise and some random variations in musical instruments and how their produce sound, which is part of the reason why musical instruments have such right and interesting sounds.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, a piano is made from wire string under great tension and so they do not vibrate like ideal strings -- instead they behave a bit like metal bars. Their oscillations are more complex and so their harmonics are not exact integer mutliple of the fundamental pitch. Indeed, piano tuners have to be trained about this less-than-ideal situation, as it affect how one tunes the piano from octave to octave. (This is call **octave stretching**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, we only included seven harmonics in our construction above. In order to be mathematically precise, we should include all harmonics, so we need an infinite sum. Our poor ears, though, can only hear the first dozen or so harmonices, so we need not worry about using these smaller sums. "
