    "1. When timbre is set to 1.0, the sound is a sine wave or a very pure tone. The spectroscope will show one peak. Why is this?\n",
    "2. When the timbre is set to 0.1, the sound has many harmonics. Can you see the various peaks? Can you pick out the exact frequency for each? The lowest frequency is call the **fundamental**. Does it agree with the frequency setting on the sliders?\n",
    "3. When the timbre is set to 0.1, the frequency of the harmonics should be multiples of the fundamental frequency. Look at the graph and find the exact frequency of each peak. Are these frequncies approximately integer multiples of the fundamental frequncy?.\n",
    "4. Can you play a note on an instument such as flute, clarinet, or violin? Can you see the harmonics for each one?"

    "Using a spectrogram we are able to display the energy in a sound, sorted by frequency. We can also see the difference between a pure tone, a musical note that is rich in harmonics, and a percussive noise like a hand clap. By observing the positions of the peaks, we can see a simple relationship between the fundamental frequency and the frequencies of the harmonics.\n",
