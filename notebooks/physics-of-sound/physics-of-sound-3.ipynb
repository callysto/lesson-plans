    "5. A more complex tone, like a singing voice or a violin playing, will show several peaks, representing the harmonics.\n",
    "6. A noise, like a hand clap or door banding, generates energy across all frequencies. \n",

    "1. When timbre is set to 1.0, the sound is a sine wave or a very pure tone. The spectroscope will show one peak. Why is this?\n",
    "2. When the timbre is set to 0.1, the sound has many harmonics. Can you see the various peaks? Can you pick out the exact frequency for each? The lowest frequency is call the **fundamental**. Does it agree with the Hz setting on the sliders?\n",
    "3. When the timbre is set to 0.1, the frequency of the harmonics should be multiples of the fundamental frequency. Check this out. Look at the graph and find the exact frequency of each peak. Are these frequncies integer multiples of the fundamental frequncy? (Or nearly so, to the accurage of your measurements. \n",
