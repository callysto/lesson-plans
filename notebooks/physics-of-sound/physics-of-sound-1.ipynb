    "## What is Sound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is simply the rapid variations, or **vibrations** in air pressure that we hear in our ears as sound. Some sounds are produced by regular vibrations of a physical object like the strings on a guitar or the head of a drum. Other sounds are more random, coming for instance from the motion of wind through leaves on a tree. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the image below, we see a close-up the strings of a guitar, and metal tuning fork made up of of two metal tines attached to a handle. In both cases, the vibrations (of the string, or the metal tines) cause the sound by exciting variations in the air pressure that travel to the ear. The wooden body of the guitar amplifies the sound by vibrating along with the string, and moving more air. \n",

    "\n",
    "For the more regular vibrations, the sounds often seem like musical notes to us. For such sounds, there are three\n",
    "important characteristics:\n",
    "- the [Amplitude](#Amplitude) or loudness\n",
    "- the [Pitch](#Pitch) which is the speed of the vibrations\n",
    "- the [Timbre](#Timbre) or quality of the sound\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ears can sense changes in all these thre characteristics. It is what helps us identify what thing is creating a sound. For instance, we can tell the difference between the sound of a musical instrument, or a person talking. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the computer to create sounds and play around with these three characteristics. "

    "The amplitude of a sound is a measure of how loud it is. For instance, a whisper is a very low amplitude sound while the roar of a motorcycle is a very loud sound. Loudness is measured in **Bels**, in honour of inventor Alexander Graham Bell. We usually use the unit of **decibels** (one-tenth of a Bel) when we talk about sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "On the computer, it is difficult to create a sound with a specific loudness or decibel rating, becauase each computer has a different set of speakers or headphones, and the user can adjust the volume setting. So it is useful to think of familiar sounds and know what their loudness is. \n",

The pitch of a sound is related to the rate of vibration of the things that is producing the sound.\n",

A violin makes sounds because the strings are vibrating, with the sound amplified by the wooden body of the instrument. A violin string can vibrate from several hundred to several thousand times per second.\n",
    "\n",
    "Low frequency sounds are caused by very slow vibrations -- think of a fog horn or whale call. High frequency sounds are caused by very rapid vibrations -- think of birds or bat sounds, or fingers scratching along a chalkboard.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ears are limited in what pitches we can hear. A young person with healthy ears can typically hear sounds with frequencies in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A piano can create notes with frequencies from about 25 Hz to 4000 Hz.\n",
