    "## What is sound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is simply the rapid variations, or **vibrations** in air pressure that we hear in our ears as sound. Some sounds are produced by regular vibrations of a physical object like the strings on a guitar or the head of a drum. Other sounds are more random, coming for instance from the motion of wind through leaves on a tree. \n",

    "For the more regular vibrations, the sounds often seem like musical notes to us. For such sounds, there are three\n",

    "- the **Amplitude** or loudness\n",
    "- the **Pitch** which is the speed of the vibrations\n",
    "- the **Timbre** or quality of the sound\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ears can sense changes in all these thre characteristics. It is what helps us identify what thing is creating a sound. For instance, we can tell the difference between the sound of a musical instrument, or a person talking. \n",

    "\n",
    "On the computer, it is difficult to create a sound with a specific loudness or decibel rating, becauase each computer has a different set of speakers, and the computer user can adjust the volume setting pretty much arbitrarily.

A violin string can vibrate from several hundred to several thousand times per second. \n",

    "Our ears are limited in what pitches we can hear. A yound person with healthy ears can typically hear sounds with frequencies in the range of 20 Hz to 20,000 Hz. A piano can create notes with frequencies from about 25 Hz to  4000 Hz\n",
