    "We thank the Tla'amin Nation and members Ms. Betty Wilson, Ms. Gail Blaine, and Mr. Tyler Peters for sharing their knowledge and wisdom on the craft of traditional basket weaving. Without their openness this project would have not taken place. We also acknowledge that this work was conducted in unceded territory of the Musqueam , Skxw√∫7mesh, Tsleil-Waututh, Kwikwetlem nations. We thank PIMS and Cybera, as well as the Government of Canada for providing financial support and infrastructure.\n",

Given a rectangular basket (without a lid cover), we see that the net of the basket consists of five shapes: one rectangle, which makes up the bottom of the basket, and four trapezoids, which make up the sides. Hence, we can add up to four motifs to generate a 3D model of a rectangular basket with motifs.\n",
