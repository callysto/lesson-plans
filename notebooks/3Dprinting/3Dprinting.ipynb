    "- [0,3,1] - the side triangle\n",

    "The order of the vertices is important. In each case, the points go counter-clockwise, as seen from the outside of the pyramid. (For the bottom surface, imagine looking from underneath the pyramid.)\n",

    "We also need to list the four vertices in (x,y,z) coordinates. We put two on the base at (1,0,0) and (-1,0,0). The third point on the base will have x and z coordinates equal to zero, and y has to be set to square root of three, to give an equilateral triangle. This gives the point (0, 1.732, 0). \n",

    "You now have a file in your Jupyter hub called surf.stl that you can print. Download this file to your local computer, then open it with your favourite 3D printing software. For instance, I am using PrusaSlicer, with is based on Slic3r. Use the Slicer software to adjust the size, add supports if necessary and adjust any other settings for the filament type and quality of print you require. Then create a g-code file and transfer this to your 3D printer. \n",
