    "\n",
    "Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air as a vibration of pressure waves. It is caused by the movement or vibration of objects, and it is detected by the ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object vibrates, it causes the air around it to vibrate as well. This vibration creates a pressure wave that travels through the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear, they cause the ear drum to vibrate, which the brain interprets as sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is characterized by several properties, including its amplitude, pitch and timbre. The amplitude of a sound wave is how loud or quiet the sound is, and is related to the energy carried by the sound. For instance, a whisper is very quiet while a jet engine is very oud. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pitch of a sound wave is related to the rate of vibrations of the oscillation, which our ears interpret in a range from a low pitch (like the hum of an car engine) to a high pitch (like the sound of a whistle). \n",
    "\n",
    "The timbre of a sound is the quality that makes one sound harsh, like the banging of garbage cans, or melodious, like the sound from a musical instrument. It is also the qualtiy that allows us to distinguish the difference between voices from one person to another, or the music of different instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many animals, including most vertebrates, can hear sounds. However, different animals have different hearing abilities. Humans, for instance, can hear sound covering a wide range of amplitudes, for instance from the whisper of a child to the roar of a jet engine. We also can hear sounds covering a wide range of pitches, from the low booming of a bass drum to the screeching scrape of fingernails on a blackboard. Other animals such as whales can hear much lower pitched sounds, while dogs and bats can hear pitches that are too high for our ears. Their audio world is much different than ours. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating sound on a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "By sending a list of numbers to the computer's speaker, a sound is generated that follows the amplitude of the values of those numbers. Essentially, the numbers become instruction on how much the speakers are to move. This motion makes small changes or vibrations in the air pressure near the speaker that then travel through the air to our ears. With the appropriate motion or vibration, we hear this as a sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the Audio tool to take the numbers in a Python list or array, and send them one by one to the speaker at a specific rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons, and respecting the limitations of humans' hearing ability, the rate is usually set at 44,100 samples per second for high quality audio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following demo, we create a long list of 44,100 zeros, and then insert 5 values equal to one, spread across the list. Pushing the \"Play\" button on the widget will produce a sound with 5 clicks in it. "

There is something that starts the vibration: for a drum, there is the drum stick hitting the head; for a violin, it could be the violin bow drawn across strings or the violinist's finger plucking the string. Finally, there is a mechanism or physical body that resonates with the vibrations and transmits them to the air, so that people can hear the sound. For the violin, this is wooden body of the violin itself; for a drum, it is the whole body of drum including the top and bottom skins, the wooden or metal sizes, and the air inside the drum. \n",

    "\n",
    "A tuning fork is a type of musical instrument that consists of a fork-shaped metal bar that vibrates at a specific pitch when struck. The vibrations of a tuning fork are periodic and produce sound waves that are characterized by their frequency, measured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). The waveform produced is very nearly a perfect sine wave, which makes this an example of a simple harmonic oscillator. \n",

    "When a tuning fork is struck, it begins to vibrate at its natural frequency, which is determined by the mass and stiffness of the metal bar. Typically, the mass and stiffness are constant so the frequency produced by the tuning fork can be used as a standard reference to tune other instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's identify the three components that produce the musical sound. First, the vibrating objects in the tuning fork are the metal tines of the fork. The initiator is what you use to hit the fork with --usually something soft like the knuckle on your hand, or a rubber mallet. (A metal mallet might damage the fork.) A tuning fork doesn't really have a resonator, so typically we touch its base to a tabletop or to a window, and let the table/window act as the resonator, transmitting the vibrations from the fork to the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most tuning forks are marked with their frequency of vibration -- the one in this photo is marked \"440\" which means 440 vibrations per second. This is known in music as the note A above middle C -- also called \"Concert A\" by musicians. \n",

    "### Tuning fork as a simple harmonic oscillator.\n",
    "\n",
    "A tuning fork is an example of a simple harmonic oscillator which moves in a periodic manner. In this case, the system is the mass of the fork's tines as propelled by the springiness of the metal. The mass and strength of the spring determine the frequency of oscillation so with a careful manufacturing process, one can produce tuning forks of precise, reliable frequencies which is used to tune other instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Some physics\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of the tuning fork is the same as for other simple vibrating systems, like the back-and-forth motion of a child's swing or the rocking of a boat in the water. \n",
    "\n",
    "The physics of this vibration are describe by two basic laws. First, when you push on the springy tine of the tuning fork, you can feel  a force that pushs back with a strength that increases the further you push the tine. This is Hooke's law, which says the force is just $-k\\cdot x$, a constant $k$ times $x$, the distance moved. Second, there is Newton's  law, that says the force on the tine must equal the mass time acceleration ($F = ma)$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Putting these two ideas together gives the equation\n",
    "$$ma = -kx,$$\n",
    "where $m$ is the mass of the tine, $k$ is the spring constant, $x$ is position of the tine, $a$ is its acceleration.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, with some calculus, we could solve for $x$ as a function of time and would see the sine wave coming up as one of the solutions. That is a bit too much to do in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "But we can do some physics using dimensional analysis! If we rewrite the above forces equation as\n",
    "$$ \\frac{a}{x} = -\\frac{k}{m},$$\n",
    "we see the behaviour of the oscillation must only depend on the ratio $k/m$. Moveover, the dimension of this ratio is the same dimension as $a/x$ which is acceleration (measured in meters per second squared) divided by position (measured meters). \n",
    "\n",
    "So the ratio $k/m$ is measured in units of $1/sec^2$, and so the square root $\\sqrt{k/m}$ is in units of $1/sec$, or Hertz. Thus we can conclude that the frequency of the oscillator is proportional to this square root:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{freq (in Hz)} = \\mbox{ constant } \\sqrt{\\frac{k}{m}}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Even without knowing the constant, we can see that increasing $k$ by making the spring \"springier\", the frequency of oscillation will go up. Increasing the mass will make the frequency go down. \n",

    "\n",
    "A penny whistle, also known as a tin whistle, is a simple, narrow-bore wind instrument that is played by blowing air through a small hole or whistle at one end, with sound resonating through the long tube attached to the whistle. It may have holes along the body of the instrument to change the pitch of the sound. The picture below shows a penny whistle with no holes, lying alongside a ruler for scale.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/PennyWhistle.jpg\" alt=\"Penny Whistle\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "To play a penny whistle, the player blows into the mouthpiece at one end of the instrument. This cause a stream of air to move through the whislte, across the fipple and labium, forcing the airstream to rapidly diverge up and down. As the player covers or uncovers the holes, it changes the effective length of the air column inside the tube, which in turn changes the pitch of the sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's again identify the three components that produce the musical sound. First, there is the vibrating object -- in this case, it is the column of air inside the narrow tube that is vibrating. Second, there is the air stream into the whistle on the end, which initiates the vibrations in the tube. Finally, the vibrations in the air column in the tube are passed on to the open air through the hole in the whistle, creating the sound we hear. \n",
    "\n",
    "### The fundamental pitch of the penny whistle\n",
    "\n",
    "The pitch or frequency of the tone created by the penny whistle is determined by the length of the air tube and the speed of sound in air. One way to envision this is to imagine a pulse of air pressure that travels from one end of the tube, and bounces off the end, as in this animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tube1.gif\" alt=\"Pulse in tube\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "The pressure pulse gets inverted at the ends because the open hole in the whistle force the net pressure change at the end must be zero. The positive and negative peaks have to cancel each other at the end. \n",
    "\n",
    "Observe that the pulse travels to one end, and then returns, travling a total distance of twice the length of the tube before repeating the cycle. If the length of the tube is $L$, and the speed of sound is $V$, then the number of cycles per second is $V/2L$, which is the frequency of the tone in Hertz.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, in the picture above, the penny whistle is about 15 cm long, while the speed of sound is about 330 meters per second. So the expected frequency is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Fundamental freq } = \\frac{V}{2L} = \\frac{330 \\, m/s}{2\\times 0.15 \\, m} = 1100 \\mbox{ cycles per second.}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This tone is transmitted through the whistle hole into the ear, which we hear as a musical note: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tube1P.gif\" alt=\"Pulse in tube, with output\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "We tested the whistle pictured above with an online pitch detector, and measured 1080 Hz, which is very close to the predicted value of 1100 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Harmonics of the penny whistle\n",
    "\n",
    "If you blow very hard on the penny whistle, you can produce a highed pitched tone. Again, the source of the sound is a pulse of air pressure travelling down the tube. However, we have enough energy to put two pulses circulating in the tube of the whistle for each cycle around the tube. This will generate twice as many pulses per second, as shown in the following animation:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tube2P.gif\" alt=\"Two pulses in tube, with output\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",
    "\n",
    "This tone is called the second harmonic and its frequency is exactly twice the fundamental frequency; that is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Second harmonic freq } = 2 \\times \\mbox{Fundamental freq }.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again as an example, for the penny whistle pictured above, we expect the second harmonic to be at\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Second harmonic freq } = 2\\times 1080 \\mbox{ Hz} = 2160 \\mbox{ Hz}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Again measuring with an online pitch detector, we observed a pitch of 2060 Hz, which is very close to the tiwce the measured fundamental frequency of 1080 Hz.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are higher harmonics, one for each integer 1, 2,3, 4, and so on. With practice, one can blow hard enough to the whistle to see the third harmonic. In this case, there are three pulses per cycle in the tube, as pictured in this animation: \n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/tube3P.gif\" alt=\"Three pulses in tube, with output\" width=\"1000\"/>\n",

    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Third harmonic freq } = 3\\times \\mbox{Fundamental freq }.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We expect a the third harmonic to be at $3\\times 1080 = 3240\\, Hz$. To be honest, our online pitch detector had a hard time measuring this third harmonic with the cheap whistle we had. We did eventually get a reading of 2790 Hz, which is more than 10 percent lower than the expected value. \n",

    "\n",
    "A slide whistle, also known as a swanee whistle or lotus flute, is a simple, narrow-bore wind instrument that is played by blowing air through a small hole at one end, producing a sliding pitch when the attached piston is moved in and out.

    "Another wave to understand the physics of sound in a tube-shaped whistle is to envision what are called **standing waves** within the tube. These are regions of oscillating pressure in the tube, where the pressure rises and falls at the frequency of the harmonic, with **nodes** or quiet spots located along the length of the tube.\n",

    "The flute has a single hole, called the blowing hole, which is located at one end of the instrument. When air is blown across the blowing hole, it creates a standing wave in the air column inside the flute. The frequency of the standing wave is determined by the length of the air column and the speed of sound in the air.\n",
    "\n",
    "The length of the air column in a flute can be changed by opening and closing holes along the length of the instrument. By opening and closing these holes, the player can produce different notes and melodies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The flute produces a sound that is characterized by even harmonics, which are frequencies that are even-numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency of the flute is 100 Hz, the harmonics would include 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 600 Hz, and so on. The harmonic spectrum of a flute helps to give it its distinctive timbre or tone."
