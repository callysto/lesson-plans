    "## Modes of oscillation\n",
    "\n",
    "A length of string, when placed under tension, will vibrate when struck or plucked with a finger or pick. Unlike the tuning fork which produces a simple sine wave at a fixed frequency, a vibrating string can oscillate in all sorts of complex motions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest one we might imagine is a simple \"bump\" that moves perpendicular to the length of the string. Imagine, for instance, the string on the ukelele fixed at the endpoints, and plucked at the centre. The oscillations might look something like this:\n",

    "<img src=\"images/string_standing_wave1.gif\" alt=\"Simple oscillation\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">Fundamental. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the fundamental mode of vibration. \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also get a more complicated oscillation when the string is plucked in two places, say upwards on the left and downwards on the right, simulateneously. The oscillations would look something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/string_standing_wave2.gif\" alt=\"Double oscillation\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">Second harmonic. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "This is called the second harmonic of vibration. In a real string, these double oscillations occur at twice the frequency as the single oscillations above. One way to see this is to imagine holding the string fixed at the midpoint. Then you have a string of half the length vibrating, and we know from our discussion of pulses on a string that the pitch is inversely proportional to length. Half the length means twice the frequency.  \n",
    "\n",
    "We can also have three oscillations, for the third harmonic, moving at three times the speed, as in the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/string_standing_wave3.gif\" alt=\"Double oscillation\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">Third harmonic. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of oscillation for these modes are alway integer multiples of the fundamental frequency which is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$$$ \\mbox{Fundamental frequency (in Hertz) } = \\frac{V}{2L},$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $V$ is the velocity of sound in the string and $L$ is the length of the string. This is the same formula for the pitch of the single pulse, above. \n",
    "\n",
    "The second harmonic mode will vibrate at twice the fundamental frequency, the third harmonic mode at three times the frequency, and so on. \n",
    "\n",
    "These different oscillations can combine, by summing up the heights of the oscillations along the points of the string. For instance, if we add the first and third harmonic, we get something like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/string_standing_wave31.gif\" alt=\"Two harmonics added\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">First and third harmonic combined. </div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The tone of this complex oscillation is a mixture of two frequncies, the fundamental frequency and three times the frequency. Our ear hears this as a pleasant chord -- a musical fifth.\n",
    "\n",
    "In fact, there are infinitely many different waveforms that are possible with the same piece of string under tension. These are all obtained by summing up different combinations of these harmonic modes, with different relative amplitudes and phases. \n",
    "\n",
    "An interesting complex waveform is the Helmholz motion of a bowed violin string, first described in the 1880's by physicist Hermann Helmholz. It looks like two straight lines with a \"corner\" that moves along the length of the string at a fixed speed, like this:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"images/helm_wave.gif\" alt=\"Helmholtz waveform\" width=\"500\"/>\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">Helmholtz motion. </div>\n",

    "Again, even this complex motion can be understood as a mathematical sum of the fundamental mode and its harmonics. \n",
