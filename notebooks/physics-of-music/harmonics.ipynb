    "A harmonic is a frequency that is an integer multiple of the fundamental frequency of a waveform or sound. The fundamental frequency is the lowest frequency in a waveform or sound, and the harmonics are the higher frequency components that are present in the waveform or sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmonics are important in music, as they contribute to the overall timbre or tone of a musical instrument or voice. In fact, most instruments do not produce one pure tone but rather a mixture of harmonics, giving different instruments and voices with unique harmonic spectrums. All the instruments mentioned above can produce harmonics, with the sole exception of the tuning fork. \n",
    "\n",
    "The harmonic spectrum of an instrument helps to define its character and distinguish it from the sounds of other instruments.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is an interesting psychoacoustic observation that the harmonics sound pleasant to our ears, and in fact form the basis for the Western music scale. \n",
