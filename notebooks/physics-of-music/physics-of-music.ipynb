    "## What is sound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air as a vibration of pressure waves. It is caused by the movement or vibration of objects, and it is detected by the ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object vibrates, it causes the air around it to vibrate as well. This vibration creates a pressure wave that travels through the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear, they cause the ear drum to vibrate, which the brain interprets as sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is characterized by several properties, including its amplitude, pitch and timbre. The amplitude of a sound wave is how loud or quiet the sound is, and is related to the energy carried by the sound. For instance, a whisper is very quiet while a jet engine is very oud. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pitch of a sound wave is related to the rate of vibrations of the oscillation, which our ears interpret in a range from a low pitch (like the hum of an car engine) to a high pitch (like the sound of a whistle). \n",
    "\n",
    "The timbre of a sound is the quality that makes one sound harsh, like the banging of garbage cans, or melodious, like the sound from a musical instrument. It is also the qualtiy that allows us to distinguish the difference between voices from one person to another, or the music of different instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many animals, including most vertebrates, can hear sounds. However, different animals have different hearing abilities. Humans, for instance, can hear sound covering a wide range of amplitudes, for instance from the whisper of a child to the roar of a jet engine. We also can hear sounds covering a wide range of pitches, from the low booming of a bass drum to the screeching scrape of fingernails on a blackboard. Other animals such as whales can hear much lower pitched sounds, while dogs and bats can hear pitches that are too high for our ears. Their audio world is much different than ours. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating sound on a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "By sending a list of numbers to the computer's speaker, a sound is generated that follows the amplitude of the values of those numbers. Essentially, the numbers become instruction on how much the speakers are to move. This motion makes small changes or vibrations in the air pressure near the speaker that then travel through the air to our ears. With the appropriate motion or vibration, we hear this as a sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the Audio tool to take the numbers in a Python list or array, and send them one by one to the speaker at a specific rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons, and respecting the limitations of humans' hearing ability, the rate is usually set at 44,100 samples per second for high quality audio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following demo, we create a long list of zeros, followed by a one, and repeat five times. Pushing the \"Play\" button on the widget will produce a sound with 5 clicks in it. (We also loading in a few useful code modules.)"

    "\n",
    "There are several characteristics that can make a sound musical, including pitch, rhythm, melody, and harmony.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pitch is the perceived highness or lowness of a sound, and it is related to the rate of oscillation of the sound wave. In music, pitch is used to create melodies, which are sequences of pitches that form a recognizable tune.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rhythm is the pattern of the duration and placement of sounds and silences in music. It is created by the arrangement of rhythms and rhythms, and it is an important element of music that gives it a sense of movement and structure.\n",

    "Melody is a sequence of pitches that form a recognizable tune. It is an important element of music that gives it its characteristic sound and helps to convey emotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "Harmony is the combination of pitches played or sung at the same time to create a chord. It is an important element of music that gives it depth and complexity, and it is created by the combination of different melodies and rhythms.\n",

First, there is something that starts a vibration: for a drum, there is the drum stick hitting the drum head; for a violin, it could be the violin bow drawn across strings or the violinist's finger plucking the string. Next, there is some object that vibrates: think of the skin of a drum, or the strings on a violin. Finally, there is a mechanism or physical body that resonates with the vibrations and transmits them to the air, so that people can hear the sound. For the violin, this is wooden body of the violin itself; for a drum, it is the whole body of drum including the top and bottom skins, the wooden or metal sizes, and the air inside the drum. \n",

    "A tuning fork is a type of musical instrument that consists of a fork-shaped metal bar that vibrates at a specific pitch when struck. The vibrations of a tuning fork are periodic and produce sound waves that are characterized by their frequency, measured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). The waveform produced is very nearly a perfect sine wave, which makes this an example of a simple harmonic oscillator. (To oscillate means to vibrate in a regular pattern.)\n",

Typically, the mass and stiffness are constant so the frequency produced by the tuning fork can be used as a standard reference to tune other instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's identify the three components that produce the musical sound. First, the initiator is what you use to hit the tuning fork with -- usually something soft like the knuckle of your hand, or a rubber mallet. (A metal mallet might damage the fork.) Next, the vibrating objects in the tuning fork are the metal tines of the fork. Finally, for the resonator, we usually touch the base of the fork to a tabletop or to a glass window, and let the table/window act as the resonator, transmitting the vibrations from the fork to the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most tuning forks are marked with their frequency of vibration -- the one in this photo is marked \"440\" which means 440 vibrations per second. This is known in music as the note A above middle C -- also called \"Concert A\" by musicians. \n",

The first three are made up of a long cylindrical pipe capped at the end with a large, horn-shaped bell at the end, while the tuba's pipe is more like a long tampered cone. The trumpet, French horn and tube have valves that adjust the length of the pipe, while the trombone has a sliding pipe that can adjust this length. \n",
    "\n",
    "To make sound on a brass instrument, the player buzzes their lips into a cup-shaped mouthpiece, which is attached to the instrument's leadpipe. This causes the air inside the insturment'a pipe to vibrate, creating sound waves that resonate in the body of the instrument. The length and diameter of the pipe, as well as the position of the valves, determine the pitch of the sound that is produced.\n",
    "\n",
    "The player can control the sound of the brass instrument by adjusting the amount of air they blow, the tightness of their lips, and the position of their tongue. Different playing techniques, such as tonguing, vibrato, and mutes, can also be used to create a wide range of sounds and effects.\n",
    "\n",
    "If a trumpet was a simple brass tube, its resonances would be the same as those of a simple closed pipe, where the lip end is the closed end. That is, we would see a fundamental resonance, and its odd harmonics appearing. However, the addition of a mouthpiece at one end and a bell-shape flare at the end changes the resonances significantly: for instance, the first five harmonics are roughly in the ratios 0.8, 2, 3, 4 and 5. The player can tighten or loosen their lips and create a sound at the frequencies 2, 3, 4, or 5 times the principal resonance, allowing them to play notes of a chord without even moving a value. \n",

    "\n",
    "The trumpet bell also changes the way sounds are transmitted to the air, so for instance the higher harmonics are radiated more efficiently than the lower frequencies, changing the timbre of the sound. The bell also has a directional pattern to how the sound radiates. Higher harmonics with higher frequencies tend to travel in a direction straight out of the bell, while lower frequencies radiate all around. This affects what the audience hears depending on their position relative to the trumpet. \n",
    "\n",
    "There is also some interesting dynamics in how the player's lips oscillate in response to the vibrations of air inside the trumpet. The lips act as a pressure-controlled valve, that release air in a burst with the reflected pressure coming from inside the instrument. This means the lips vibrate in synchrony with resonances of the trumpet, which is how the player is able to sustain an accurate pitch. \n",

Some key differences include their size and shape, the type of reed used in the mouthpiece (single reed for clarinets and saxophones, double reeds for oboes and bassoons, no reed at all for a flute or recorder), and the shape of the borehole in the body of the instrument (cylindrical for flutes and clarients, and a tapered cone for oboes, bassoons and saxophones). \n",
    "\n",
    "Of the reeded woodwinds, the clarinet with its cylindrical bore behaves like a half-open pipe, so the vibrating column of air in the instruments supports mainly the odd harmonics. This gives the clarient its characteristic woody tone. The resonances of the air column determine the fundamental pitch of clarinet reed as there is a strong feedback been the reed and the vibrating air. The tone holes on the side of the instrument are used to select the notes that sound, as opening a hole at a certain point will surpress the standing wave modes that don't have a node there. \n",
    "\n",
    "The oboe, bassoon, English horn and saxophone have conical boreholes, which turn out to behave like an open pipe. So both even and odd harmonics are present in their notes. The oboe also emphasize certain clusters of resonant frequencies, known as **formants** (around 1000 and 3000 Hertz), which appears to be a property of its double reed. The bassoon also shows the presence of a formant, at a lower frequency. \n",
    "\n",
    "The regular pattern of holes along the side of the woodwind instrument create a cutoff filter that surpresses harmonics of frequencies greater than some fixed number, depending on the type instrument. For instance, different clarinets will have cutoff frequencies in the range of 1000 to 1500 Hertz, making each one sound darker or brighter, depending on the cutoff. \n",

    "## Organ pipe\n",
    "\n",
    "An organ pipe is a tube-shaped musical instrument that produces sound by means of a vibrating column of air. The vibrations in an organ pipe are periodic and produce sound waves that are characterized by their frequency and wavelength.\n",
    "\n",
    "In an open organ pipe, the air column inside the pipe is free to vibrate at both ends. This type of pipe produces a sound that is characterized by odd harmonics, which are frequencies that are odd-numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency of the pipe is 100 Hz, the higher harmonics would include 300 Hz, 500 Hz, 700 Hz, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "In a closed organ pipe, one end of the pipe is closed off, while the other end is open. This type of pipe produces a sound that is characterized by even harmonics, which are frequencies that are even-numbered multiples of the fundamental frequency. For example, if the fundamental frequency of the pipe is 100 Hz, the harmonics would include 200 Hz, 400 Hz, 600 Hz, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "The frequency of the oscillations in an organ pipe is determined by the length of the pipe and the speed of sound in the air inside the pipe. The frequency can be changed by adjusting the length of the pipe or by changing the temperature or humidity of the air inside the pipe.\n"

    "A violin is a stringed musical instrument that is played with a bow. It is one of the members of the violin family of instruments, which also includes the viola, cello, and double bass. The violin has a distinctive, high-pitched sound that has made it a popular instrument in classical music, as well as in many other musical styles.\n",

    "\n",
    "The sound of a violin is produced by the vibration of its strings. The strings are made of steel or gut and are stretched between the tailpiece and the bridge. When the player draws the bow across the strings, they cause the strings to vibrate. These vibrations are then amplified by the body of the violin, which acts as a resonating chamber. The shape and size of the violin, as well as the materials used to make it, all contribute to the unique sound that it produces.\n",
    "\n",
    "The sound can be varied by the player by changing the speed and pressure of the bow, as well as by changing the position of the bow on the strings. The player can also produce different sounds by pressing the strings down against the fingerboard, which changes the length of the vibrating string and thus the pitch of the sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the strings and the body, the sound of the violin is also influenced by the chin rest and the tailpiece, as well as by the strings and the bow. Professional violinists often experiment with different components to find the combination that produces the sound they are looking for.\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall we have a formula related the pitch of a vibrating string, its length, and the velocity of sound in the string:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Pitch frequency (in Hertz) } = \\frac{V}{2L}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Rearranging this, we can compute the speed of sound in a violin string as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\mbox{Velocity (in meter/sec) } = {2L}\\cdot{freq}.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The highest pitched string on a violin is the E string, which vibrates at a frequency of 660 Hz. The length of the string is about 32.5 cm, so we find the speed is\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Velocity  } = {2(.325)}\\cdot{660} = 429 m/s,$$\n",
    "\n",
    "which is faster than the speed of sound in air!\n",
    "\n",
    "The violin strings can vibrate in complex pattern, and support both the even and odd harmonics of the fundamental frequency. The right sound of the violin comes from the complex resonances of the violin body, which is a vibrating three dimensional solid frame surrounding a volume of air inside. Understanding these resonances is key to understanding how the violin is able to produce the sounds it does. \n",
