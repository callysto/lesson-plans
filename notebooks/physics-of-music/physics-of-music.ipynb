    "## What is sound?\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is a type of energy that travels through the air as a vibration of pressure waves. It is caused by the movement or vibration of objects, and it is detected by the ear.\n",
    "\n",
    "When an object vibrates, it causes the air around it to vibrate as well. This vibration creates a pressure wave that travels through the air. When these pressure waves reach the ear, they cause the ear drum to vibrate, which the brain interprets as sound.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sound is characterized by several properties, including its amplitude, pitch and timbre. The amplitude of a sound wave is how loud or quiet the sound is, and is related to the energy carried by the sound. For instance, a whisper is very quiet while a jet engine is very oud. \n",
    "\n",
    "The pitch of a sound wave is related to the rate of vibrations of the oscillation, which our ears interpret in a range from a low pitch (like the hum of an car engine) to a high pitch (like the sound of a whistle). \n",
    "\n",
    "The timbre of a sound is the quality that makes one sound harsh, like the banging of garbage cans, or melodious, like the sound from a musical instrument. It is also the qualtiy that allows us to distinguish the difference between voices from one person to another, or the music of different instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Many animals, including most vertebrates, can hear sounds. However, different animals have different hearing abilities. Humans, for instance, can hear sound covering a wide range of amplitudes, for instance from the whisper of a child to the roar of a jet engine. We also can hear sounds covering a wide range of pitches, from the low booming of a bass drum to the screeching scrape of fingernails on a blackboard. Other animals such as whales can hear much lower pitched sounds, while dogs and bats can hear pitches that are too high for our ears. Their audio world is much different than ours. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Simulating sound on a computer\n",
    "\n",
    "By sending a list of numbers to the computer's speaker, a sound is generated that follows the amplitude of the values of those numbers. Essentially, the numbers become instruction on how much the speakers are to move. This motion makes small changes or vibrations in the air pressure near the speaker that then travel through the air to our ears. With the appropriate motion or vibration, we hear this as a sound. \n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, we use the Audio tool to take the numbers in a Python list or array, and send them one by one to the speaker at a specific rate.\n",
    "\n",
    "For historical reasons, and respecting the limitations of humans' hearing ability, the rate is usually set at 44,100 samples per second for high quality audio. \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following demo, we create a long list of 44,100 zeros, and then insert 5 values equal to one, spread across the list. Pushing the \"Play\" button on the widget will produce a sound with 5 clicks in it. "

First, there is something that starts a vibration: for a drum, there is the drum stick hitting the drum head; for a violin, it could be the violin bow drawn across strings or the violinist's finger plucking the string. Next, there is some object that vibrates: think of the skin of a drum, or the strings on a violin. Finally, there is a mechanism or physical body that resonates with the vibrations and transmits them to the air, so that people can hear the sound. For the violin, this is wooden body of the violin itself; for a drum, it is the whole body of drum including the top and bottom skins, the wooden or metal sizes, and the air inside the drum. \n",

    "A tuning fork is a type of musical instrument that consists of a fork-shaped metal bar that vibrates at a specific pitch when struck. The vibrations of a tuning fork are periodic and produce sound waves that are characterized by their frequency, measured in cycles per second, or Hertz (Hz). The waveform produced is very nearly a perfect sine wave, which makes this an example of a simple harmonic oscillator. \n",

Typically, the mass and stiffness are constant so the frequency produced by the tuning fork can be used as a standard reference to tune other instruments. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's identify the three components that produce the musical sound. First, the initiator is what you use to hit the tuning fork with --usually something soft like the knuckle of your hand, or a rubber mallet. (A metal mallet might damage the fork.) Next, the vibrating objects in the tuning fork are the metal tines of the fork. Finally, for the resonator, we usually touch the base of the fork to a tabletop or to a glass window, and let the table/window act as the resonator, transmitting the vibrations from the fork to the air. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most tuning forks are marked with their frequency of vibration -- the one in this photo is marked \"440\" which means 440 vibrations per second. This is known in music as the note A above middle C -- also called \"Concert A\" by musicians. \n",
