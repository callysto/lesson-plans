    "With the goal of sparking discussion surrounding responsible use of machine learning, especially as it applies to health data, it might make sense to first look at what the data says about us, even when it's been anonymized.\n",
    "\n",
    "Using the NHANES demographic data, is it possible to find small pockets of unique sets of observations that could potentially lead to 'removing the veil' if we we know enough information about someone? This can highlight just how easy it is uniquely describe a person, given enough data. An important part of data literacy is understanding the value of privacy, and just how easily we give up our data without thinking about what it reveals about us.\n",
