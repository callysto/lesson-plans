    "As our world becomes increasingly digitized and interconnected, our reliance on data has also increased. Devices connected to the internet get [stranger every day](https://www.metrikus.io/blog/10-weirdest-iot-enabled-devices-of-all-time), a fairly recent trend made possible by advances in computing, the internet, and data-storage technology. Technology is becoming such an integrated part of our lives that it is easy to forget how much information is collected about us, and who has access to it. This is especially true for health data, which should be private and can have negative effects if it falls into the wrong hands.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this notebook and activity we'll look at ways that data impacts your life, from its collection to its applications. We'll focus on health data, with information about what you can do to ensure your data isn't used in a way that negatively impacts you. Hopefully you'll develop an appreciation for how data can paint a picture of who you are, and how it can be used to your benefit or detriment."

    "A classic example of using health data is [determining the source of a cholera outbreak in London in 1854](https://www.rcseng.ac.uk/library-and-publications/library/blog/mapping-disease-john-snow-and-cholera/). Cholera is a [nasty bacterial disease](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/cholera/symptoms-causes/syc-20355287) that affects the digestive tract. Ahough it's rare today in developed nations, it still results in the [deaths of tens of thousands of people](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/cholera) across the world *each year*. \n",
    "\n",
    "At the time, many people were moving to London, and the sewage system wasn't able to handle all the waste. In one area of the city this resulted in sewage contaminating the drinking water supply, which led to an outbreak of cholera. At its peak over [600 people were dying each week from the disease](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7150208/).\n",
    "\n",
    "A young physician named [John Snow](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Snow) rejected the leading theory that cholera was an airborne disease, and insisted that it spread through water. To illustrate his point, he recorded the locations of the homes of those who had died from cholera, and added that data to a map of the area. The map also had the locations of the water pumps that provided the drinking water for the nearby homes.\n",

The current technology trend is to collect as much information as possible from as many people as possible, usually to help guide decisions or influence their behaviour. On the surface it may feel like the data serves a useful purpose, such as Google customizing its search results or Amazon recommending purchases for you. However your data could be used in ways that you may not like, such as when [social media data was leveraged to influence elections and political referendums](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facebook%E2%80%93Cambridge_Analytica_data_scandal).\n",

These protections only apply to governmental agencies like [AHS](https://www.albertahealthservices.ca/about/page121.aspx) though, so any data collected by or voluntarily given to private organizations could be misused. Imagine your health condition being leaked to your employer, or perhaps predictive algorithms being the first to inform you of a health issue you weren't yet aware of. It is important to consider who may access your data when you choose to disclose it to people, organizations, apps, or websites."
