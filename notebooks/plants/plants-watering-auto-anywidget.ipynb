The data can be viewed directly on the computer screen, and the water pump can be activated to water the plant.\n",

    "You can disconnect by clicking the \"Disconnect\" button above. Or, simply close this notebook. \n",

    "#### Troubleshooting and/or not working?\n",
    "If your are unable to read the data from the sensors, you can try the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Click disconnect and reconnect botton in this notebook\n",
    "2. Check that the senors are connected to the VINT HUB Phidgets\n",
    "\n",
    "## Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "We have demonstrated the process of running a utility that retrieves Phidget sensor data and publishes it on the web. This operation involves a combination of Javascript and Python to interact with both the front-end and back-end components within the Jupyter notebook environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you plan to collect data over an extended period, it's essential to have the Jupyter \"Hub\" software installed on your local computer. Please note that if you run this software on the [Callysto hub](https://hub.callysto.ca), it may automatically disconnect after approximately a day of continuous data collection.\n",
    "\n",
    "You might also like to go back to the data collection notebooks: \n",
