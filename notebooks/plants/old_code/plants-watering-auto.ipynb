    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to collect data from certain hardware sensors called [Phidgets](https://www.phidgets.com/education/learn/projects/plant-kit/). This kit has all the sensors we need to monitor the environment of the plant, along with a water pump and control. The data can be viewed directly on the computer screen, and the water pump can be activated to water the plant.\n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you follow the detailed setup for the Plant Kit provided by the Phidget company. The instructions are here: https://www.phidgets.com/education/learn/projects/plant-kit/introduction/\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Phidget Plant Kit](https://www.phidgets.com/education/learn/projects/plant-kit/) contains several components. To set up this notebook, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Phidget VINT Hub (HUB0000), with cables attached\n",
    "- the DC power supply (PSU2000), attached to Port 1 on the VINT Hub\n",
    "- the water pump (KIT4014), attached to the power supply, \n",
    "- the moisture Phidget (device type HUM1100), attached to the VINT Hub\n",
    "- the light sensor (device type LUX1000_0), attached to the VINT Hub\n",
    "- and optionally, the temperature/humidity sensor (device type HUM1001_01).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four main steps in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up gauges and buttons on the screen to view the sensor data and control the water pumo.\n",
    "2. Set up the sensors and pump as software inputs/outputs to computer and connet to the software can communicate.\n",
    "3. Test that the water pump works by pressing the on-screen button, and turn on the auto-watering system.\n",
    "5. Observe the system over several days, to adjust the moisture level and check the computer is watering automatically when it should. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cells in this notebook, one cell at a time. This will give you the chance to respond to any errors and fix things if necessary. You may also select \"Run All\" to execute the whole notebook -- just be prepared to respond to any error messages. \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have a plant, with the sensors, water reservoir, and pump  nearby. This what the plant setup should look like:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div align=\"center\">\n",
    "<img src=\"images/plant-water.jpg\" alt=\"A plant with sensors and water pump\" width=\"400\"/><br>\n",
    "A plant with sensors and water pump.\n",

    "1: Pump. 2: DC power supply. 3: Moisture probe. 4: Light sensor. 5: Humidity sensor. 6: VINT Hub\n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "The notebook runs both Python code and Javascript (JS) code. It would be nice to do everything in Python, but it seems Javascript is necessary to communicate with the Phidgets in a Jupyter notebook. Fortunately, the Javascript code here is easy enough to read and you will not need to change it. "
