    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The purpose of this notebook is to collect data from certain hardware sensors called \"Phidgets\" which are set up to monitor the environment of a plant, and also to water the plant. The data can be viewed directly on the computer screen, and a water pump can be activated from a simple water pump.\n",
    "\n",
    "We are using a complete kit for plant monitoring that is available from the Phidgets company (https://phidgets.com) This kit has all the sensors we need to monitor the environment of the plant, along with a water pump and control to water the plant. \n",
    "\n",
    "We recommend you follow the detailed setup for the Plant Kit provided by the Phidget company. The instructions are here: https://www.phidgets.com/education/learn/projects/plant-kit/introduction/\n",
    "\n",
    "The Phidget Plant Kit contains several components. To set up this notebook, make sure you have the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- the Phidget VINT Hub (HUB0000), with cables attached\n",
    "- the DC power supply (PSU2000), attached to Port 1 on the VINT Hub\n",
    "- the water pump (KIT4014), attached to the power supply, \n",
    "- the moisture Phidget (device type HUM1100), attached to the VINT Hub\n",
    "- the light sensor (device type LUX1000_0), attached to the VINT Hub\n",
    "- and optionally, the temperature/humidity sensor (device type HUM1001_01).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are for main steps in this notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up gauges on the screen to view the data from the plant sensors.\n",
    "2. Set up the plant sensors as software inputs to computer. Ensure that the softare can communicate with them.\n",
    "3. Test that the water pump works by pressing the on-screen button.\n",
    "5. Observe the changes in the moisture readings once the plant has been watered. \n",
    "\n",
    "Run the cells in this notebook, one cell at a time. This will give you the chance to respond to any errors and fix things if necessary. Do not select \"Run All.\" \n",
    "\n",
    "You should have a plant, with the sensors, water reservoir, and pump  nearby. This what the plant setup should look like. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Note: Keep it away from computer and electronic devices as much as possible.**\n",
