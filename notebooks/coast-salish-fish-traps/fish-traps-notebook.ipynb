    "### Northern Coast Salish and the sea\n",
    "\n",
    "We refer to 'fish traps' as *intertidal* (meaning seashore areas covered when the tide is high, and uncovered when the tide is low) rock walls that trap fish. \n",
    "\n",
    "Researchers [[1]](#Acknowledgements) have studied a the different kinds of intertidal modifications that allowed Coast Salish Peoples to capture fish more easily. In this notebook, we will explore the different elements involved in fish traps, and focus our attention on one specific type of trap: the crescent element. \n",
