    "## Phidget_2 Humidity and Temperature\n",
    "\n",
    "This short notebook builds on how we access a Phidgets device from a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be modifying code from Phidgets_1 in order to get both temperature and humidity to display on the screen.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to run this notebook in the Google Chrome web browser, on a desktop or laptop computer. Unfortunately, other browsers (FireFox, Safari, Edge) will not work as they cannot access the USB port that connects to the Phidget device. That may change in the future, but at the time of writing, this is currently only possible in Chrome.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 style=\"color: red\">IMPORTANT</h2>\n",
    "You MUST click the <span style=\"color:red\">BIG, RED DISCONNECT BUTTON</span> at the end of this notebook when you are done. This tells the software to release the Phidget device, so it can be used by other notebooks you might try later.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Setting up the Phidget device\n",
    "\n",
    "We will be using the Phidget Starter Kit, as shown in this figure:\n",
    "<img src=\"images/KIT4003.jpg\" alt=\"Image of the starter kit\"  width = 500 />\n",
    "\n",
    "Verify these points:\n",
    "- Get a hold of a Phidgets Starter Kit. It should already be assembled. If not, assemble it now.\n",
    "    - You will have received instructions with the kit on how to assemble it.\n",
    "- The Starter Kit has a humidty sensor attached. If it does not, find the sensor and attach it.\n",
    "    - The humidty senor is a small black box attached with a thin cable. It is marked with the initials \"HUM.\"\n",
    "- Connect the Starter Kit to your computer with a USB cable. \n",
    "    - The Kit come with a USB cable, it is attached to the Hub device inside the Starter Kit.\n",
    "- If you have an older version of the Phidgets, you may need to update its firmware. See the following for details:\n",
    "    - https://www.phidgets.com/education/educators/advanced-troubleshooting/firmware-upgrade/\n",
    "- As mentioned above, make sure you are running this notebook in the Google Chrome browser. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview of the code.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a bit tricky to use the Phidget device, as we have to \"tell\" the computer explicity that we want to use the Phidget. This means writing code that tell the computer that, first, we want to use the USB port and cable to connect to the device, and then we want to use a specific device in the starter kit, and finally we want to read data from that deive. \n",
    "\n",
    "We will do this in a step-by-step manner, so we can understand how the connection process works. At the end, it is always good practice to clean things up by closing all the connections. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main steps are thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "0. Import some Python libraries\n",
    "1. Import the Phidget library, in Javascript\n",
    "2. Define and open the USB connection\n",
    "3. Open the Humidity and Temperature devices\n",
    "4. Read some values from the devices\n",
    "5. When we are done, close the devices and USB connection\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's get into the details"
