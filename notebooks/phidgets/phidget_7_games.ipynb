    "This is a really open ended exercise for the students.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is important to run this notebook in the Google Chrome web browser, on a desktop or laptop computer. Unfortunately, other browsers (FireFox, Safari, Edge) will not work as they cannot access the USB port that connects to the Phidget device.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2 style=\"color: red\">IMPORTANT</h2>\n",
    "You MUST click the <span style=\"color:red\">BIG, RED DISCONNECT BUTTON</span> at the end of this notebook when you are done. This tells the software to release the Phidget device, so it can be used by other notebooks you might try later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is to create a game using the push buttons and lights on the Phidgets Starter Kit. Some ideas include:\n",
    "- A speed test, where a light goes on at random and the code measures the time it takes the player to react by pushing the button.\n",
    "- A two-button speed test. The green or red light comes on at random, and the player must react by hitting the corresponding button. With the speed measured, as above\n",
    "- A pattern game. The lights flash in a random pattern (e.g. Red, Red, Green, Red, Green) and the player must repeat the pattern by pushing the button. \n",
    "- Or perhaps a \"prompt\" appears on the screen, and the player must push the corresponding button. Say, a picture randomly of an example of \"food\" or \"office supplies\" and the player must push \"Green\" for food, and \"Red\" for office supplies.\n",
    "\n",
    "Or think of your own game. \n",
    "\n",
    "A good place to start is the code in the notebook Phidget_6_buttons, which shows how to connect to the buttons and turn on and off the light. \n",
    "\n",
    "The basic code is repeated here. Can you modify it to make a game?\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 will be left the same as before. It is at Step 5 that you want to start modifying the code to make this into a game. "
