    "In a [previous notebook on fish traps](https://tinyurl.com/y37hrspp) we learned about the crescent element -  a type of intertidal modification used by Northern First Nations to trap fish, such as salmon. In this notebook, we will explore the impact of harvesting salmon on the salmon population size over the course of several years. \n",
