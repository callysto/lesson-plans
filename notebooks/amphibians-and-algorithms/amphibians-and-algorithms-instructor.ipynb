    "There are two ways to introduce the Frog Jumping Problem.  The first way is to show the following YouTube video, which presents the problem and walks the students through the scenario with 3 red frogs and 3 green frogs.  To play the video, click the triangular \"Play\" button appearing in the middle of the video's screen.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "If you do show the video, make sure you cut off the video at the 2:30 mark, just after the solution is revealed.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The second (and better) way to introduce the Frog Jumping Problem is to invite six students to come up to the front of the classroom.  They will sit in a line of seven chairs, with an empty chair in the middle.  The three students on the left will be the red frog team, and the three students on the right will be the green frog team.  If you have access to coloured gym pinnies, have each student put on a red or green pinny corresponding to their team colour.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Now introduce the rules: the red team can only move to the right, and the green team can only move to the left.  On any move, a student can either <i>Slide</i> into the empty chair, or a <i>Jump</i> over one player from the other team into the empty chair.  The goal is to have the two teams swap positions, where the green team ends up on the left and the red team ends up on the right.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "If the six students are ever stuck, and cannot make a legal move, then they have to start from the beginning.  They are to keep going until the game is solved, where the three green students are on the left and the three red students are on the right.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Students will need to be reminded that reds can only jump over greens, and vice versa.  Also, in each jump, a player can only jump over one player from the opposite colour.</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Have the six students try to solve the game, either working amongst themselves, or enlisting the help of everyone else in the class.  I highly recommend that the students attempt this without talking.  When I lead this activity, I say this to the students: \"you may communicate in any way that you wish, but you can't use words\". </font>\n",
    "\n",
    "The solution appears in the YouTube video below.  If we denote the team names as Green (G) and Red (R), this sequence of fifteen moves solves the problem: G, R, R, G, G, G, R, R, R, G, G, G, R, R, G</font>\n",

    "Write down the correct move sequences on the board, and ask students if they notice any patterns.  They might notice that the number of moves required is 8, 15, and 24, respectively.  Perhaps it's not a coincidence that 8=2x4, 15=3x5, and 24=4x6.  They can use this information to predict the number of moves that will be required to solve larger instances of the problem, which they will do momentarily.    \n",
    "    \n",
    "Another key insight is that the letters G and R in the move sequence occur in <i>blocks</i>.  So what we can do is express the move sequences as a code of numbers, where each number represents how many consecutive moves of that colour we make.  For example, the sequence G, R, R, G, G, R, R, G can be thought of as 1G, 2R, 2G, 2R, 1G, and we can write this as 12-2-21.    \n",

    "\n",
    "And now the pattern will be clear to the students.  For 10 frogs, with five of each colour, the correct code is 12345-5-54321, and they can use this code to create the desired move sequence of G's and R's.  Bring 10 volunteers up to the front of the class to illustrate this, to show how the move sequence G-RR-GGG-RRRR-GGGGG-RRRRR-GGGGG-RRRR-GGG-RR-G solves the problem with 5 green frogs and 5 red frogs.</font>\n",
